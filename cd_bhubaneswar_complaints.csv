Can we please put barricades to separate lanes on the ring Road and mark the lanes at which people can take turns. Thereby, people travelling straight are on their lane and people traveling left and right queue up their lane.

Majority of times, I've seen vehicles riding extreme right to take the left service road and block the ongoing traffic. This should be avoided.

There is froth around everywhere which leads to health issues for people in and around those areas. Roads are pathetic. There are more potholes on road that the roads itself. People who used to think about spending quality life in Bangalore now wishes to get away from here. Lack of proper infrastructure also means that the traffic is utterly mismanaged. This isn't what we expect from the Silicon Valley of India. This city deserves to get its pride back.
